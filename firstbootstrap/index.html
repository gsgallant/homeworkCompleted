			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<img src="assets/images/profilepic.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

			<p>I've had an interesting career path, to say the least!  I was a freelance software developer while in college in the 1970's and then continued doing software development in the 1980's for a software house while attending dental school. The languages I worked in extensively were popular at the time and included MUMPS, BASIC (compiled), FORTRAN, COBOL, and Assembler.  After graduating from dental school in 1984, I began practicing dentistry full-time and owned and ran my own dental practice.  I continued in dentistry for 31 years, retiring in May, 2015. While in dental practice I did programming for home automation systems in a proprietary language for Control-4 systems.</p>

			<p>Attending the Rutger's Boot Camp after retiring from dentistry was a natural next career step for me! It allowed me to bring my software training into the 21st Century. I'm extremely excited to get back in to the software industry to exercise those technical and creative muscles that I enjoy using so much!</p>
